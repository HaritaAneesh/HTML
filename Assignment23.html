            Introduction to HTML
        </div>  
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create
        and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of most websites, defining 
        elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. HTML uses tags 
        enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <p> for paragraphs, <a> for links) to indicate 
        different types of content. While it doesn't control how a website looks—that's 
        handled by CSS—it plays a critical role in organizing information. Without HTML, 
        web browsers wouldn't know how to display content correctly. Learning HTML is 
        the first step toward web development and creating interactive online experiences.

        A typical HTML document starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, signaling 
        to the browser that it’s an HTML5 document. The content is wrapped within <html> tags, 
        which are divided into two main sections: the head and the body. The <head> section 
        contains metadata, such as the document title (<title>), links to CSS stylesheets,
        and character encoding (<meta> tags). The <body> section holds the visible content,
        including text, images, and links. Properly nesting elements and using semantic 
        tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> help improve readability, 
        accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO).
